# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Model-Through-Intuition



In this project we used the Mathematics to predict the Heart Disease through Logistic Regression Model .


In logistic first we initialize the weight and bias , Forward and Backward , Update the weight , predict . 

All formula and intuition taken from the Andrew Ng .
